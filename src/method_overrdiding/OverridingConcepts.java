/*if the same method is defined in both the superclass and the subclass,

 s
 * Java Overriding Rules
Both the superclass and the subclass must have the same method name, 
the same return type and the same parameter list.
We cannot override the method declared as final and static.
We should always override abstract methods of the superclass.
